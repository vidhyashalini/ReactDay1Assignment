What are keys in React JS? How keys are involving  in array processing?

*In React, keys are special attributes that provide a way to identify and differentiate between the items in a list of elements. 
When rendering a list of elements in React, each element should have a unique key. The key is used by React to efficiently 
update and re-render the components, especially when the list changes (e.g., items are added, removed, or reordered).
Keys help React identify which elements have changed, been added, or been removed. 
*When React reconciles the virtual DOM with the actual DOM, it uses keys to determine the correspondence between the old 
and new elements, making the process more efficient.
*Keys should be assigned to elements inside an array, typically when using the map() function to render a list of components.

Here's how keys are involved in array processing:

Identifying Elements:

*Keys are used to identify each element in the array uniquely.
React uses these keys to track the identity of elements between renders.

*Efficient Updates:
When a component re-renders and the array changes (items are added, removed, or reordered), React uses keys to efficiently update the DOM.
Keys help React determine which elements have changed, been added, or been removed.

*Reconciliation Algorithm:
React's reconciliation algorithm uses keys to match elements in the new array with elements in the previous array.
If keys remain the same between renders, React assumes the elements represent the same thing, and it updates only the necessary parts of the DOM.

*Preventing Unnecessary Re-renders:
Keys help React identify which elements have been added or removed, preventing unnecessary re-renders of unaffected components.
Without keys, React may re-render components unnecessarily, leading to decreased performance.

*Stable Identity:
Keys should be stable, meaning they should not change between renders unless the identity of the item itself changes.
It's important to use a unique and stable identifier for each item as the key.

How to display images in React JS?

1 Method-In React, you can display images using the standard HTML <img> tag. You provide the src attribute with the URL or path to the image file. 
imageUrl = 'https://example.com/image.jpg';
 <div>
      <h2>Image Display</h2>
      <img src={imageUrl} alt="Description of the image" />
    </div>

2 Method- If images are part of your React application (i.e., in your project directory), can import the image and use it directly:
import myImage from './images/myImage.jpg';
<div>
      <h2>Image Display</h2>
      <img src={myImage} alt="Description of the image" />
    </div>
